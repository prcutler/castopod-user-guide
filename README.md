# The Castopod User Guide
User guide and documentation for [Castopod](https://www.castopod.org), the open source podcasting platform.

This was a proof of concept written in mkdocs.  This has been ported to Astro Starlight and merged with the [official Castopod documentation](https://docs.castopod.org/main/en/user-guide/).
