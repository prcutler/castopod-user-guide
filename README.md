# The Castopod User Guide
User guide and documentation for [Castopod](https://www.castopod.org), the open source podcasting platform.

## What is Castopod?

[Castopod](https://www.castopod.org) is an open source self-hosted podcast platform.  Castopod allows you to engage 
and interact with your audience with its built-in social network connected to the Fediverse.

You can view the [Castopod User Guide here](https://prcutler.github.io/castopod-user-guide/).

## Contributing

Contributions and suggestions are always welcome! Please make pull requests from your own fork to modify the 
Castopod User Guide.  If you are not comfortable using git and GitHub and find an error, you can also [open 
a new issue](https://github.com/prcutler/castopod-user-guide/issues).

Imposter syndrome disclaimer: I want your help. No really, I do.

There might be a little voice inside that tells you you're not ready; that you need to do one more tutorial, 
or learn another framework, or write a few more blog posts before you can help me with this project.

I assure you, that's not the case.

The contribution guidelines below outline the process that you'll need to follow to get a patch merged. 
By making expectations and process explicit, I hope it will make it easier for you to contribute.

Thank you for contributing!

The workflow is similar to the one explained in detail here for CircuitPython: [Adafruit : Contribute to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github/overview).
