# Manage Fediverse Blocks

You can block a Fediverse user or an entire domain to help stop harassment or spam.

## Blocked Accounts

by pressing the `Unblock` button.

## Blocked Domains

To block an entire domain, enter the domain name such as `www.example.com` in the **Domain Name** field and press 
`Block`.

A list of all blocked domains is shown below the **Domain Name** text box.  You can choose to unblock a domain 
by pressing the `Unblock` button.
