# Managing your instance

## What is an instance?

Your podcast is hosted on your sever and connected to the fediverse in what is called an "instance".  Your 
instance can manage multiple podcasts, people and users, and host additional pages found on all of your podcasts.

Managing your instance, including podcasts, people, and users is separate from the settings for each 
individual podcast.
